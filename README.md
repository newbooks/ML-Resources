# Python Machine Learning Resources

In this guide, I have curated a selection of resources to assist beginners in getting started with Python-based AI projects.

## AI Tools for Productivity
- **[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/):** Leverage AI to summarize sources like web links, research papers, videos, and audio content. It also enables you to ask questions and take notes effectively.
- **[GitHub](https://github.com/):** Manage your code repositories, utilize AI-powered coding assistance, and showcase your coding expertise for career growth.
- **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/):** Get answers to general queries and enhance your search results with AI-driven insights.

## Setting Up Python Programming Environment
A Python programming environment typically consists of the following components:

- **Linux-like Environment:** A terminal-based setup or tools that emulate a Linux environment for seamless development.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Tools like PyCharm, VS Code, or Jupyter Notebook to write, debug, and manage your code efficiently.
- **Packages and Modules:** Libraries and frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to extend Python's functionality for machine learning and data analysis.

### Windows - WSL
While Linux and macOS come with a built-in Linux-like environment, Windows users need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to access a Linux terminal. You can find the installation guide at [Microsoft Learn - Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Here is a sample procedure to install WSL with an Ubuntu Linux distribution:

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator: Right-click the Start Menu and select **"Windows PowerShell (Admin)"**.
2. Run the command: `wsl --install`.
3. Once the installation completes, restart your computer.
4. After restarting, search for **"Ubuntu"** in the Windows Start Menu to launch the WSL Ubuntu app.
5. On the first launch, WSL will take some time to initialize. You will then be prompted to set up a username and password for the first user.

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
- **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/):** Connect to remote SSH servers or WSL environments seamlessly, with support for GitHub's AI-powered coding assistance.
- **[PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download):** A Python-focused IDE designed for efficient coding and debugging.
